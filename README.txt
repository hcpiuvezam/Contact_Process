Contact Process Programming to study

During the height of the Pandemic (2020), my PhD advisor asked me to reproduce certain figures from Chapter 6 of the book Nonequilibrium Phase transitions in lattice models. And I thought I'd use this tool to not only document this experience and possibly receive some constructive advice but also help out other students that might be having some trouble understanding or building up these models.

(I apologise for my inadequacy in this but I'm just learning how to use it.)

The first c++ program is a simple one. It merely runs the model 'trials' times and documents the summed activity in a '.dat' file.
